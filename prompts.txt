The best part of using chat gipity was how it helped me debug JavaFX issues, especially with
launching multiple applications within the same JVM instance. It was very good at analyzing
my code and identifying where I could implement concepts from each lesson. It also helped generate
boilerplate code and assisted with commenting, refactoring, and creating static variable names.

The worst parts occurred after the game logic was complete and I needed refactoring to meet the
assignment requirements. I asked gipity to reorganize code such as moving logic into an abstract
class and overriding methods while keeping the existing logic the same. Even with explicit
instructions not to change behavior, it still altered the logic and introduced bugs that I had
to spend a little while debugging.

Gipity is a useful tool that can speed up development and improve the overall coding experience,
but it still struggles with larger codebases and strictly following constraints. It often broke
rules like avoiding magic numbers or separating declarations and assignments, and sometimes
modified working code. It’s a good assistant for certain tasks, but the core, important coding
is still best done manually. Future jobs are safe—for now.
